# Notes App ES6

This is a simple notes app created in ES6, so I can learn how to set up and run a project in ES6. I will be using Test Driven Development, using Jest. 

Documenting my steps below, so I can easily refer back. Feel free to clone and have a look around.

## Getting started

- clone repository and open
